The GALactic Archaeology with HERMES survey provides spectra for 400
objects in 4 wavelength bands tailored to obtain a range of chemical element lines. The GALAH data products will yield a
comprehensive view of the formation and evolution of the Galaxy, enabling the reconstruction of the original stellar building blocks.
