<p>The SAMI Galaxy Survey began in March 2013, with the intention of creating a large survey of ~3400 galaxies across a
    large range of environments. The key science goals of the SAMI Survey are to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul class="paragraph-list p">
    <li>What is the physical role of environment in galaxy evolution?</li>
    <li>What is the relationship between stellar mass growth and angular momentum development in galaxies?</li>
    <li>How does gas get into and out of galaxies, and how does this drive star formation?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The data for the SAMI Galaxy Observatory is being collected using SAMI, the
    Sydney-Australian-Astronomical-Observatory Multi-object Integral-Field Spectrograph. SAMI is a brand new instrument
    on the 4-meter Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory. Integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) allows a
    unique view of how stars and gas zoom around inside distant galaxies because we collect dozens of spectra across the
    entire face of each galaxy.

<h4>Data Release 1</h4>
<p>
    Galaxies included in the SAMI DR1 are drawn from all galaxies observed in the GAMA regions as of June, 2015 (AAT
    semesters 2013A to 2015A) meeting the survey quality control requirement: 772 individual galaxies. For more details
    on SAMI DR1 please see Green et al. (2017) <span style="color:red">[link to be added]</span> as well as the <a
