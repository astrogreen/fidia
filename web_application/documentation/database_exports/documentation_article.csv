11;"A Format Independent Data Interface for Astronomy: FIDIA";4;"data-central-a-format-independent-data-interface-for-astronomy-fidia";"<p class=""lead"">...because I don&rsquo;t care what format the spectra is in!!!</p> <p>At AAODC we use a custom-built middleware package to organise and access astronomical data. FIDIA seeks to free the astronomer to think about stars and galaxies and their spectra, magnitudes, velocities and other properties by combining a standardised, high-level data model with community developed interfaces to many common data sources. Analysis code written using FIDIA is&nbsp;highly portable, making it easier to apply existing analysis methods to new data, or bring existing data into new analysis.</p> <h2>Why &ldquo;Format Independent&rdquo;?</h2> <p>While the computer literate among us discuss and debate endlessly the advantages and disadvantages of various data formats, most astronomers just want to get on with doing science. They only care about the format of data if they can&rsquo;t open and interact with their own and communal data seamlessly in their analysis tool of choice. A uniform Data Program Interface (or Data API) for astronomy simplifies not only the options for the astronomer to interact with data from various sources and in various formats, but also offer the possibility for developers to support multiple formats and sources with no additional development cost.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Context</h2> <p>More and more, astronomy is becoming a data driven rather than observation driven science. Astronomers now care as much about bringing together diverse existing data sets and applying new analysis as about collecting new data and applying existing analysis methods. Both of these depend on interacting with data in a variety of formats and places (FITS, HDF, cloud based, database, files, etc.) The IVOA has already developed a comprehensive set of standards covering data storage (VOTables), data communication (TAP, SAMP), and data typing (Universal Content Descriptors) to help make interaction with data as seamless as possible. FIDIA can take advantage of that infrastructure where available, but can work around its absence when necessary to provide a consistent experience for the astronomer for all data sets.</p> <h2>What is FIDIA?</h2> <p>FIDIA is a Python package for interacting with data for astronomical objects in a consistent and intuitive manner, regardless of the source or format of the data. It also provides a standardised, high level data model, organising data by astronomical object and physical meaning. The package accepts that data will always be available in a wide variety of formats and places, and therefore it provides a formulaic way to connect to and import from new data sources such as on the user&rsquo;s computer. The package takes care of mundane details such as memory management, local caching, unit tracking, etc. The reference package is written in Python, but implementations in other languages are possible.</p> <p>Following the success of astropy, FIDIA invites community contributions to reduce the need for astronomers to re-invent data import code or develop new data models. Plug-ins for data access can read both local and remote data, eliminating the need to download large remote data sets, and allowing code to be uploaded for &ldquo;bring code to the data&rdquo; style execution.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>";"2016-08-31 08:40:36.531548+08";"2016-08-31 08:46:48.915897+08";"";;

Considerable past work has focused on standardised formats and protocols for working with data. However, these tools are structured around images and tables, not stars and galaxies. We take such work a step further by defining an interface to data on disk, on the web, in a database, etc. that has a vocabulary (based in part on existing IVOA UCDs) for the physical properties of astronomical objects. In our package, the primary objects are astronomical objects, such as stars and galaxies, with data members such as spectra, magnitudes and velocities. By presenting the properties and measurements of objects in this way, we simplify analysis and visualisation by providing a uniform representation of an astrophysical object's characteristics.</p> <p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 16px; opacity: 0.87; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;"">The package accepts that data will always be available in a wide variety of formats and places, and therefore it provides a formulaic way to connect to and import from new data sources with ease.

Our aim with FIDIA is to provide a consistent and intiutive experience for all AAODC users, regardless of astronomical knowledge, and to provide a scalable and something data model for connecting new data tools to our interface.</p>";"2016-08-26 17:50:57.926894+08";"2016-08-31 14:34:19.117076+08";"";"";
